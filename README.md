# Bitcoin Runes Governance System

A comprehensive DAO governance solution built on Bitcoin using Runes technology.

## Overview

The Bitcoin Runes Governance System provides an OpenZeppelin-like wizard for creating and managing decentralized governance systems on Bitcoin. This project enables Bitcoin users to implement sophisticated governance mechanisms previously only available on smart contract platforms.

## Features

### Basic Token Functionality
- Token creation (etching) with configurable parameters
- Minting and transfer capabilities
- Supply management tools
- Metadata configuration

### DAO Governance
- Proposal creation and management
- UTXO-based voting system
- Vote tallying and result execution
- Governance analytics dashboard

## Architecture

The system is built with a modular architecture consisting of:

- **User Layer**: Wallet connections and user interfaces
- **Governance Layer**: Token contracts and proposal management
- **Voting System**: UTXO-based voting mechanisms
- **Security Layer**: Signature verification and weight processing
- **Transaction Layer**: Bitcoin network integration
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Visualization and data analysis

npm install

# Start development server
npm start
```


## Technical Documentation

### System Components

#### UTXO-based Voting
Votes are cast using Bitcoin UTXOs, with each transaction containing voting data in OP_RETURN outputs. This approach leverages Bitcoin's native transaction model for secure, transparent voting.

#### On-chain Data Storage
Proposal metadata and voting results are stored on the Bitcoin blockchain using OP_RETURN data fields, ensuring transparency and immutability.

#### Security Model
The system implements multiple security layers, including signature verification, transaction validation, and vote weight calculation based on token holdings.

## Challenges and Solutions

### Limited Bitcoin Scripting
Bitcoin's restricted scripting capabilities required creative solutions for implementing complex governance mechanisms.

**Solution**: Leveraged Runes technology and OP_RETURN data fields to extend functionality while maintaining Bitcoin's security properties.

### Data Storage Constraints
Bitcoin's limited on-chain storage presented challenges for storing proposal metadata.

**Solution**: Implemented efficient data encoding and selective on-chain storage strategies.

## Roadmap

- **Q2 2025**: Add advanced voting mechanisms (quadratic, conviction)
- **Q3 2025**: Implement delegation capabilities
- **Q4 2025**: Create mobile interfaces and SDK
- **Q1 2026**: Deploy integration with Lightning Network
